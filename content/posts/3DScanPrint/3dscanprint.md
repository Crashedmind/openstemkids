## 3D Scan and Print a Toy Duck

[![3DPrinter](./yt.jpg)(https://youtu.be/GL8B_cfy2xE)]


## Event

Maker project advice + tinkering + 3D Object Scanning [@ dlr LexIcon](https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?markers=icon%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fsecure.meetupstatic.com%2Fs%2Fimg%2F5961591462445047%2Fmup-custom-google-map-pin.png%7C53.292835%2C-6.132073&zoom=17&size=480x300&sensor=false&key=AIzaSyA3fSxhHZNQNfMjJuMFvmULACXrBfFz9jQ&signature=UpxPT8VNCTqPHQRTUanyjgXJqUE%3D) Hosted by Jake Byrne


## Activity

1. We brought along a toy duck and Dobby per the invite
2. Jake setup the [HP Sprout](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/sprout-pro/overview.html) to 3D scan the duck - rotating it so all the surface was captured
3. Reduce the size of the final model so it prints quicker
4. Save the STL (STereoLithography) file to SD card
5. Insert SD card into 3D Printer (Ultimaker 2)
6. Print... 
7. Watch and wait for 30 minutes as the duck takes shape layer by layer

## The End Result

From left to right:
1. Dobby who could not be scanned. Due to some Harry Potter magic or because the scanner filters out human skin colours.
2. The original duck in green that was scanned
3. The smaller duck in pink that was printed. We'll give it some colour and features by painting it.
