The Makeblock Neuron system offers over 30 electronic blocks, including a voice sensor, light sensor and infrared sensor. It makes it very easy for kids to create functional circuits easily e.g. an ultrasonic distance measurement tool, a voice-activated emoji. Components can be programmed also.

Overall, it's a very polished product: from the block design, user friendliness, packaging, support material and documentation.
And it's fun and educational to play with.

## Spare parts
Individual parts can be ordered from various stores e.g. https://www.kiwi-electronics.nl in Europe.

Some parts are fragile e.g. 
- the knob where the knob can be twisted too much and the plastic pillar between the know and the resistor snaps. This is about 13 EUR.
- the LED which has wires soldered 

The Makeblock Neuron All-in-one-kit comes with 2 power supplies. 
An extra power block allows more simultaneous activities - and is handy in case power is low on another block.

## Under the hood
